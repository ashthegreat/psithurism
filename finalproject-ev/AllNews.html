                <p>WASHINGTON — President Trump signed an executive order on Monday blocking citizens of six predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States, the most significant hardening of immigration policy in generations, even with changes intended to blunt legal and political opposition.<br><a href="Fullarticles.html">.......continue Reading</a>

             <h3>Fianna Fáil to publish proposals on a reunified Ireland</h3><span class="headline hl6"> By RTE, Thursday 2 MARCH, 2017 </span>
                  
             <p>Micheál Martin said there is a need to know what would happen if a referendum passed to reunite Ireland.
                  
               Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has said the party is putting together a white paper on what a reunified Ireland would mean in a practical sense if a referendum on the matter was to be held and passed.

               Mr Martin said he believed arrangements would include the continuation of parliaments both North and South.
  
               Other matters such as integrating education and healthcare systems would have to be considered<br>

                  <span class="headline hl6">By James Masters,  TUESDAY 28 FEB, 2017</span>


                  <p> Britain could begin the formal process of leaving the European Union as early as Tuesday if legislation approving the move passes its final hurdles on Monday.

             Both houses of the UK parliament will vote on the EU Withdrawal Bill later. If it is passed, the bill would allow Prime Minister Theresa May to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which governs the relationships between EU member states <br>

                  <h3> A Refugee Crisis in a World of Open Doors</h3>
                   <span class="headline hl6">By VIET THANH NGUYEN, MONDAY 20 FEB, 2017</span>
                  <p>You own a house or rent an apartment. You live with your family or by yourself. You wake in the morning and drink your coffee or tea. You drive a car or a motorbike, or perhaps you take the bus. You go to work and turn on your computer. You go out at night and flirt and date. You live in a small town or big city, although maybe you are in the countryside. You have hopes, dreams and expectations. You take your humanity for granted. You keep believing you are human even when the catastrophe arrives and renders you homeless. Your town or city or countryside is in ruins. You try to make it to the border. Only then, hoping to leave, or making it across the border, do you understand that those who live on the other side do not see you as human at all.<br>
