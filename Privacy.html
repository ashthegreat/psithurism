<p class="privacy"><strong> Psithurism What's New in the Updated Privacy Policy? We have updated the privacy policy applicable to our online and mobile websites, applications, and digital services and clarified data collection, usage and sharing practices among Turner, its affiliates and unaffiliated third parties. Please take the time to read the full privacy policy. You consent to the data collection, use, disclosure and storage practices described in this privacy policy when you use any of our Services (as described below), including when you access any content or videos.</strong></p>

<p class="privacy"><strong>  Thank you for visiting this website, a digital service presented to you by Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. ("Turner", "we" or "us"). Your privacy is important to us. As such, we provide this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used by this digital service and among Turner's network of affiliated and operated digital services ("Turner Network"), which includes any online or mobile websites, applications or digital services owned, operated or offered by, on behalf of, or in conjunction with Turner or its Affiliates, including any online or mobile website, application or digital service installation through which this Privacy Policy appears (each a "Service," collectively the "Services"). "Users" are persons that use the Services.</strong></p>


                      
<h3>1. The Information We Collect</h3>

<h3> 1.1 Information You Provide To Us.</h3>

<p class="privacy"> We receive both information that is directly provided to us, such as personal information you provide when you visit the Services, and information that is passively or automatically collected from you, such as anonymous information collected from your browser or device. In this Privacy Policy, we refer to all of this as the "Information".</p>
                      
 <p class="privacy">At some Services, you can register, order products, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as our online newsletters or text message alerts, or participate in one of our online forums or communities. In the course of these various offerings, we often seek to collect from you various forms of information, such as: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number and credit card information. </p>                     
                      
  <p class="privacy">At some Services, you may also be able to submit Information about other people. For example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail address to send an electronic greeting card and, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might submit the recipient's name and address. This Information may include, for instance, a recipient's name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number. </p>                    
                      
                      

<h3> 1.2 Information That is Passively or Automatically Collected.</h3>

<p class="privacy"> We, and our "Partners" who include Turner Affiliates, third party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies, and distribution or other partners may use automated means to collect various types of Information about you, your computer or other device used to access our Services. A representative, non-exhaustive list of the types of automatically collected information may include: network or Internet protocol address and type of browser you are using (e.g., Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Microsoft Windows or Mac OS), the name of your Internet service provider (e.g., Comcast, Verizon or AT&T) and domains used by such providers, mobile network, device identifiers (such as an Apple IDFA or an Android Advertising ID), device settings, browser settings, the web pages of the Services you have visited, Services visited before and after you visit a Service, the type of handheld or mobile device used to view the Service (e.g., iOS, Android), location information, and the content and advertisements you have accessed, seen, forwarded and/or clicked on. Please see our Section titled Cookies, and Other User and Ad-Targeting Technologies for more information about how the foregoing Information may be collected and used.</p>

<h3> 1.3 Geo-location Information.</h3>

<p class="privacy">If you are accessing a Service from a mobile device or through a mobile application, you may be asked to share your precise (GPS level) geo-location information with us so we can customize your experience on our Services or on other Services, when we work with a Partner such as a third party mobile ad platform. If you agree to such collection, in most cases, you will be able to turn off such data collection at any time by accessing the privacy settings of your mobile device and/or through the settings in the applicable mobile application.</p>

<h3> 1.4 Information Collected By and From Social Media Services and Other Third Party Platforms.</h3>

<p class="privacy"> When we interact with you through our content on third party websites, applications, integrations or platforms, we may obtain any information regarding your interaction with that content, such as content you have viewed, your game performance, high scores, and information about advertisements within the content you have been shown or may have clicked on.</p>
                      
<p> 
                          
</p>

<h3> (a) Cookies.</h3>

<p> A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows Customized Fat Loss For Men to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in Customized Fat Loss For Men's database. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites.</p>

<h3> (b) Web Beacons.</h3>

<p> A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an programming function -- see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows Customized Fat Loss For Men to track certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, Customized Fat Loss For Men might place, with the consent of a third party website, a web beacon on the third party's website where fishing products are sold. When Bill, an individual listed in Customized Fat Loss For Men's database, visits the fishing website, Customized Fat Loss For Men receives notice by means of the web beacon that Bill visited the fishing site, and Customized Fat Loss For Men would then update Bill's profile with the information that Bill is interested in fishing. Customized Fat Loss For Men may thereafter present offers of fishing related products and services to Bill. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, Customized Fat Loss For Men also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in Customized Fat Loss For Men's database.</p>

<h3> (c) New Technology.</h3>

<p> The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is Customized Fat Loss For Men's use of new and evolving technology.

<p> Customized Fat Loss For Men will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If Customized Fat Loss For Men obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect such information, Customized Fat Loss For Men has no such information to use or to disclose to third parties. Customized Fat Loss For Men has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").</p>

<h3> 1.8 Credit Card Information.</h3>

<p> Customized Fat Loss For Men may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and related information, such as the expiration date of the card ("Credit Card Information") when an individual places an order from Customized Fat Loss For Men. When the Credit Card Information is submitted to Customized Fat Loss For Men, such information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software.
